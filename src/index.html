        <span>A Poem by&nbsp;</span><span>John Greenleaf Whittier</span>
      </h2>
      <p class="poem__stanza">
        Oh, greenly and fair in the lands of the sun,<br>
        The vines of the gourd and the rich melon run,<br>
        And the rock and the tree and the cottage enfold,<br>
        With broad leaves all greenness and blossoms all gold,<br>
        Like that which o'er Nineveh's prophet once grew,<br>
        While he waited to know that his warning was true,<br>
        And longed for the storm-cloud, and listened in vain<br>
        For the rush of the whirlwind and red fire-rain.
      </p>
      <hr class="poem__rule">
      <p class="poem__stanza">
        On the banks of the Xenil the dark Spanish maiden<br>
        Comes up with the fruit of the tangled vine laden;<br>
        And the Creole of Cuba laughs out to behold<br>
        Through orange-leaves shining the broad spheres of gold;<br>
        Yet with dearer delight from his home in the North,<br>
        On the fields of his harvest the Yankee looks forth,<br>
        Where crook-necks are coiling and yellow fruit shines,<br>
        And the sun of September melts down on his vines.
      </p>
      <hr class="poem__rule">
      <p class="poem__stanza">
        Ah! on Thanksgiving day, when from East and from West,<br>
        From North and from South comes the pilgrim and guest;<br>
        When the gray-haired New Englander sees round his board<br>
        The old broken links of affection restored;<br>
        When the care-wearied man seeks his mother once more,<br>
        And the worn matron smiles where the girl smiled before;<br>
        What moistens the lip and what brightens the eye,<br>
        What calls back the past, like the rich Pumpkin pie?
      </p>
      <hr class="poem__rule">
      <p class="poem__stanza">
        Oh, fruit loved of boyhood! the old days recalling,<br>
        When wood-grapes were purpling and brown nuts were falling!<br>
        When wild, ugly faces we carved in its skin,<br>
        Glaring out through the dark with a candle within!<br>
        When we laughed round the corn-heap, with hearts all in tune,<br>
        Our chair a broad pumpkin, our lantern the moon,<br>
        Telling tales of the fairy who travelled like steam<br>
        In a pumpkin-shell coach, with two rats for her team!
      </p>
      <hr class="poem__rule">
      <p class="poem__stanza">
        Then thanks for thy present! none sweeter or better<br>
        E'er smoked from an oven or circled a platter!<br>
        Fairer hands never wrought at a pastry more fine,<br>
        Brighter eyes never watched o'er its baking, than thine!<br>
        And the prayer, which my mouth is too full to express,<br>
        Swells my heart that thy shadow may never be less,<br>
        That the days of thy lot may be lengthened below,<br>
        And the fame of thy worth like a pumpkin-vine grow,<br>
        And thy life be as sweet, and its last sunset sky<br>
        Golden-tinted and fair as thy own Pumpkin pie.
      </p>
